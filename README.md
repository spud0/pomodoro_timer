# Pomodoro Timer
A Pomodoro Timer written in Go. 

## How it Works: 
This project depends on [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for the styling of the terminal. This project MAY also depend on [lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) for adding tabs to the 'pages' in the timer. 

## Run it!
```
go git ... 

```

## Why? 
I wanted to build a simple timer application that can work in the TUI. 

## Usage
This code uses ```Ctrl+C```, and ```q``` to quit the application. The other key that can be used as input is ```p``` to pause the timer.
```
Usage of pom: 
	- hrs 
		The number of hours, that the timer needs to run
	- mins
		The ... of mins, that the timer needs to run
	- secs
		The ... of seconds, that the timer needs to run
```

# Pomodoro Timer
A Pomodoro Timer written in Go. 

## How it Works: 
This project depends on [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for the styling of the terminal. This project also depends on [lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) for adding tabs to the 'pages' in the timer. 

## Run it!
```
go git ... 
```

## Why? 
I wanted to build a simple timer application that can work in the TUI.
